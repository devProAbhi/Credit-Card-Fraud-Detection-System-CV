# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-System

->  Fraud is one of the major ethical issues in the credit card company


-> It is important that credit card companies are able to recognize fraudulent credit card transactions so that customers are not charged for items that they did not purchase


-> In this project we built a model using CNN which predicts if the transaction is genuine or fraudulent and we will get an accuracy upto 96%
